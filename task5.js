// Aircraft OOP
// How would you model this behaviour?

// As the wing and flaps are components of an Aircraft
// I would turn them into related functions/methods.
// Too much inheritance can lead to confusion!

class Aircraft {
  constructor() {
    // define constructor function given to object instances
  }

  wing() {
    // some stuff
  }

  flap() {
    // some stuff
  }
}
